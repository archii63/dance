# Simple Greeting Project

This is a simple Python project that asks for the user's name and prints a greeting message.

## Features

- Easy to understand
- Good for beginners who want to upload their first GitHub project

If you want, I can also:  
✅ create a full GitHub-ready folder structure  
✅ generate more advanced code (web app, API, chatbot, etc.)  
✅ write the entire README for you
